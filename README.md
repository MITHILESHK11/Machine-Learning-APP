## Introduction

This **ML Platform** provides a robust framework to streamline machine learning workflows, from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and deployment. It offers a simple interface for running experiments and managing models. The platform also provides scalability for production use with integration tools for popular cloud services.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the platform, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.8+**: The platform requires Python version 3.8 or above. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git**: Git is used for version control. Install Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Package Manager**: Preferably `pip` for installing dependencies.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-platform.git
   cd ml-platform
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install all required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use `conda` if you prefer:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

4. **Install Jupyter Notebook (optional)**:

   If you intend to run notebooks as part of your workflow, install Jupyter:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```

## Platform Structure

### Directory Structure

The platform follows a modular structure. Below is an overview of the directory and file layout:

```
ml-platform/
├── config/
│   └── config.yaml               # Configuration file for platform settings
├── data/
│   └── raw/                      # Raw datasets (can be populated manually or via scripts)
│   └── processed/                 # Preprocessed data (saved during pipeline execution)
├── notebooks/                     # Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
├── scripts/                       # Helper scripts for training, testing, and preprocessing
│   ├── train_model.py             # Script for model training

```

### Modules

- **Data Preprocessing** (`data_preprocessing.py`): Contains functions for cleaning, transforming, and normalizing the input data.
- **Feature Engineering** (`feature_engineering.py`): Provides functions for creating new features, selecting features, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model** (`model.py`): Includes functions for training models, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics.
- **Deployment** (`deployment.py`): Contains functions for deploying trained models to production, including saving models and generating predictions.

## Usage

### Training

To train a model, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Data**: Ensure that the data is placed in the correct directories (`data/raw/` for raw data).
   
2. **Preprocess Data**: Execute the data preprocessing script:

   ```bash
   python scripts/preprocess_data.py
   ```

   This will clean and preprocess the data and save it in `data/processed/`.

3. **Train Model**: Train the model using the training script:

   ```bash
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```

   This will:
   - Load the preprocessed data
   - Split the data into training and validation sets
   - Train the model using a specified algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks)
   - Save the trained model in the `models/` directory

4. **View Training Output**: The script will output training metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and loss.

### Model Evaluation

To evaluate the trained model:

1. **Evaluate Model**: Run the model evaluation script:

   ```bash
   python scripts/test_model.py
   ```

   This will:
   - Load the trained model
   - Evaluate it on the test data
   - Output various evaluation metrics (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC-AUC score, etc.)

### Deployment

To deploy the trained model into a production environment, follow these steps:

1. **Save Model**: After training, save the model using the deployment script:

   ```bash
   python scripts/deployment.py --save_model
   ```

2. **Deploy Model**: Once saved, the model can be deployed using any deployment method (e.g., cloud service, REST API). You can integrate with frameworks such as Flask, FastAPI, or Django.

## Configuration

Configuration settings for the platform (e.g., dataset paths, model parameters, training options) are managed in the `config/config.yaml` file.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
data:
  input_path: "data/raw/dataset.csv"
  output_path: "data/processed/processed_dataset.csv"

model:
  type: "RandomForestClassifier"
  hyperparameters:
    n_estimators: 100
    max_depth: 5
    random_state: 42

training:
  batch_size: 32
  epochs: 50
```

### How to Modify Configuration

You can modify the configuration file to change parameters like:
- Model type (e.g., RandomForest, SVM, Neural Network)
- Hyperparameters (e.g., `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`)
- Paths to data and output directories
